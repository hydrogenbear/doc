"本文将介绍如何利用 poption 对冲 :ref:`无常损失<il_math>` "
"。在金融市场中，利用衍生品转移风险是常见的做法。当资产价值随某一价格波动产生变化的时候，我们可以购买和这一变化相反收益曲线的衍生品来对冲变化带来的不确定性，规避损失。由于衍生品往往是高资金效率的，持有这样的衍生品往往只占用一小部分资金，所以这样做对稳定收益是十分有意义的。"

"This article will describe how to use poption to hedge against "
":ref:`impermanent losses<il_math>`. It is common practice to use "
"derivatives to shift risk in financial markets. We can buy derivatives to"
" cover our losses elsewhere. Because poption are usually highly capital "
"efficient, it would not cost much and would be efficient to hedge loss."

"green and blue lines are closely aligned over a wide range. In this "
"range, poption can hedge the risk perfectly. In cases of drastic price "
"changes, the poption does not provide a full hedge, but only a partial "
"one. So the two lines are separated. This is because the poption market "

"In the Ethereum ecosystem, There is not only poption that offers the "

msgid ""
"首先 poption "
"是一个通用的衍生品产品。用它来对冲损失是直接的简单的，不需要通过合成多种金融产品来实现对冲功能。此外它的通用性决定了它在售出一个对冲产品的同时也售出它的反面，当poption自动做市商将一个对冲无常损失的poption定价过高的时候，投机者可以通过做空这样的poption来获益。这样对于有对冲需求的投资者有两个好处。"
msgstr ""
"First of all poption is a general purpose derivative product. Using it to"
" hedge losses is quite straightforward and simple, without synthesizing "
"multiple financial products to achieve the same goal. General purpose "
"also means that it accepts long and short at the same time. When a "
"poption auto market maker overprices a poption that hedges an impermanent"
" loss, speculators can benefit from shorting such a poption. This also "
"bring two benefits to the hedger."

#: ../../source/hedge_il.rst:62
msgid ""
"对冲无常损失的poption价格必须是公允的，流动性池必须给出正确的poption "
"定价否则投机者可以通过购买相反payoff的poption套利。单方面的估价往往会因利益关系导致错误定价，比如造成2007年金融危机的次级贷的错误估价就是如此。在poption中任何人都可以沽多或沽空任意的收益曲线，买和卖是完全对称的，定价最终由市场完成，这将有效的保护市场和买家。"
msgstr ""
"The poption price to hedge impermanent losses must be fair. Liquidity "
"pools must provide correct pricing or they will suffer loss from "
"speculators. Unilateral valuations are often biased due to stakes. For "
"example, the subprime mortgages that caused the 2007 financial crisis "
"were misvalued. In poption, anyone can long or short a payoff curve. "
"Buying and selling are completely symmetrical, and the price is "
"determined by the market, which will effectively protect both the market "
"and the buyers."

msgid "通过市场价格信号，当对冲无常损失的产品有较高需求的时候，我们能从投机者那里获取用于对冲损失的资产而不是仅仅依靠流动性提供这来提供这些资产，这有助于稳定资产价格。"
msgstr ""
"Through market price signals, when there is high demand for products that"
" hedge against impermanent losses, we are able to get the asset from "
"speculators rather than just relying on liquidity providers, and this "
"also helps stabilize the prices."

msgid "其次在市场中有一些对冲无常损失的产品是有非常严重的兑付风险的。而在 poption 中是没有此类风险的，它的收益在到期后是必然能够兑现的。"

"Secondly there are some products in the market that are subject to very "
"serious redemption risk. Whereas in poption there is no such risk and it "
"is always fully collateralized."
