"我们从最简单的保证金交易开始理解 poption "

"We start with margin trading to construct a leveraged trade in poption. "
"In margin trading we borrow some money from a brokerage and use that "
"money, together with our own, to buy some assets. Then we will take "

"我们看到这个收益曲线中有负的一部分，这是因为当资产价格下跌后我们持有的资产的价值就会低于借入的资金价值。这个时候我们就没法还清全部的借款了，券商可不希望这样，他要确保自己能收到还款。因此此时我们就会收到追缴保证金通知或者更进一步的，被清仓。但其实我们并不希望欠券商钱或者被强制交易不是么？那么我们应该把这部分风险转移出去。我们可以通过购买"

"We see a negative portion of this payoff curve because when the asset "
"price drops, the value of the asset will be less than the value of the "
"money borrowed. At that point we will not be able to pay back all the "
"loans, which the brokerage doesn't want, so we will get a margin call or,"
" even worse, a liquidation. However we don't want to owe money to the "
"broker or be forced to trade, do we? How about shifting that risk. We can"
" do this by purchasing a `put option "
"<https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/introduction-to-options"

"看，现在收益曲线中没有负数的部分了，不管价格怎么变，我们都不会欠券商钱，因为我们不会欠券商钱，券商也不能给我们清仓，强迫我们交易。可以看到通过一个看空期权，我们把风险转移到了期权卖家手中。此外由于这样的看跌期权是一个"

"中做市商和投资者的位置是完全对称的，做市商保护自己不被清算的需求和普通投资者是一样的，资产价格的持续上涨会导致裸空的期权卖家承受被挤兑的风险，为了回避这部分风险，做市商不会向投资者卖出这部分期权。最后可以被交易的"

"Now that there is no more negative part of payoff curve, no matter what "
"the price changes, we will not owe the brokerage money. Because we won't "

"derivatives to make the trade safer with a small extra cost. In a "
"poption, the market maker's need to protect itself from liquidation is "
"the same as that of any other investors. A very high increase in the "
"price of the asset will lead to the risk of a short squeeze on the naked "
"option writer. To avoid this risk, the market maker will not sell this "
"part of the option to the investor. The yield curve of the final tradable"

"在传统金融市场中，利用资金优势或者信息优势，通过控制市场中的流动性恶意轧压对手的情况比比皆是。在过去的一年中，就有 GME "
"事件，原油宝事件，伦敦镍事件发生。可见清算风险即便是专业人士也很难防范，并且这些事件严重破坏了金融市场的安全和稳定。这是我们在设计 poption"
" "
"之初就想避免的。我们不希望我们市场中的交易者因为清算的压力而被迫去做自己并不愿做的交易。我们希望每一笔交易都来自市场的真实需求和对标的物价值的认真评估。此外这也帮助我们将自动做市商设计得更简单。由于有限的算力，在链上评估清算风险会非常困难，如果存在这样的风险自动做市商在一些情况下会给出错误的报价，从而造成流动性池中的资金损失。这也是我们不愿看到的。"

"In the legacy financial markets, there are many cases of malicious "
"squeeze cause by controlling of liquidity in the market by taking "
"advantage of capital or information. In the past two years, there have "
"been GameStop Short Squeeze, Negative WTI Crude Futures Prices Event and "
"LME Nickel Squeeze. These events show that liquidation risks are "
"difficult to prevent even for professionals. These events also seriously "
"undermine the safety and stability of financial markets. This is what we "
"want to avoid when we design poption. We do not want traders in our "
"markets to be forced to make trades they unwilling to because of the "
"pressure of liquidation. We hope every trade reflects market demand or "
"the value of the settlement currency but not squeeze. Such a design also "
"helps us to make the implementation of automated market makers simpler. "
"Due to the limited calculation resources, it can be very difficult to "
"assess liquidation risk on chain, which leads auto market makers giving "
"wrong quotes and liquidity pool suffering losses. It is necessary to "
"prevent this at the beginning of the design. In poption, any payoff with "
"a negative part or without an up bound will not be supported. This makes "
"all the poption fully collateralized all the time and no one will face "
"liquidation at any moment."
